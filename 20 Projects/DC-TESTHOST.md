*Devon requested that I take a look at the drives that are available on Disctech and come up with a solution*

### We will be running a PowerEdge R830 with eight drive bays

1. We will run the OS in the first 2 drive bays in RAID 1
2. The next 4 drive bays will be in RAID 10 with 7.68TB drives

## Daily Log
### [[2024-08-14]]
- [ ] Worked with Devon to discuss how we would deploy the drives in the test server
	- [ ] Discussed the 7.68TB drives in RAID 10. I would suggest getting the non OM drives as they are half the price
