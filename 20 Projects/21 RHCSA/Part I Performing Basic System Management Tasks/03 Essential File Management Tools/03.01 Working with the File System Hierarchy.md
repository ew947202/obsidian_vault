## Define the File System Hierarchy

File system Hierarchy Standard (FHS) is described in ``man 7 file-hierarchy`` 


| Directory Use |                                                                                                                                    |
| :-----------: | :--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
|       /       | Specifies the root directory. This is where the file system<br>tree starts.                                                        |
|     /boot     | Contains all files and directories that are needed to boot<br>the Linux kernel.                                                    |
|     /dev      | Contains device files that are used for accessing physical<br>devices. This directory is essential during boot.                    |
|     /etc      | Contains configuration files that are used by programs<br>and services on your server. This directory is essential<br>during boot. |
|     /home     | Used for local user home directories.                                                                                              |
| /media, /mnt  | Contain directories that are used for mount                                                                                        |
|     /opt      | Used for optional packages that may be installed <br>on your server                                                                |
|     /proc     | Used by the proc file system. This is a file system <br>structure that gives access to kernel information                          |
|     /root     | Specifies the home directory of the root user                                                                                      |
|     /srv      | May be used fir data by services like NFS, FTO, and HTTP                                                                           |
|     /sys      | Used as an interface to different hardware devices<br>that are managed by the Linux kernel and associated<br>processes             |
|     /tmp      | Contains temporary files that may be deleted without <br>any warning during boot                                                   |
|     /usr      | Contains subdirectories with program files, libraries, for <br>these program files, and documentation about them.                  |
|     /var      | Contains files that may change in size dynamically, such <br>as log files, mail boxes, and spool files.                            |
## Understanding Mounts
A mount is a connection between a device and a directory. Linux file system is presented as one hierarchy, with the [[root directory]] (/) as its starting point. The hierarchy may be distributed over different devices and even computer systems that are mounted into the root directory
