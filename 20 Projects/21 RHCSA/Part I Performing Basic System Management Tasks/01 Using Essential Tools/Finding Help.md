>[!important] The **man** command is the most important resource for getting help about command syntax and usage

### Using --help
The quickest way to get an overview of how to use a command is by running the command with the *--help* option

### Using man
The *man* command is what makes working from the command line doable. If you do not know how a command is used, the man page of that command will provide valuable insight.

The most important part of the man page in general are at the bottom of the man page. Here you will find two important sections. In many cases there are examples; if there are no examples there is always a "See Also" section.

### Finding the Right man Page
To find information in man pages, you can search the mandb database by using *apropos* or *man -k*.

### Using info
Apart from the information that you'll find in man pages, another system provides help about command usage. This is the *info* system. Most commands are documented in man pages, but some command have their main documentation in the info system and only show a short usage summary in the man page.
