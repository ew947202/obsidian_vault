## Working with Wildcards

| Wildcard Use |                                                                                                                                                                         |

| *****        | Refers to an unlimited number of characters. *ls * *, for<br>instance, shows all files in the current directory (except <br>those that have a name starting with a dot) |
| **?**        | Used to refer to one specific character that can be any <br>character. **ls c?t** would match as *cut*                                                                  |
| **[auo]**    | Refers to one character that may be selected from the<br>range that is specified between square brackets.<br>**ls c[auo]t** would match cat,cut,cot.                    |

## Managing and Working with Directories
To organize files, Linux works with [[directories]] (also referred to as folders).

## Working with Absolute and Relative Pathnames

An [[absolute filename]], or absolute pathname, is a complete path reference to the file or directory you want to work with. No matter what your current directory is, absolute filenames will always work.

A [[relative filename]] is relative to the current directory as shown with the **pwd** command. It contains only the elements that are required to get from the current directory up to the item you need.

>[!tip]
>Always use [[absolute filename]] it will lead to fewer mistakes.
