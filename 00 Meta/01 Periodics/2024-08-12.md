## Notes
- Helped [[Jim Friel]] with his old device that was still having the CrowdStrike issue 
- Was able to successfully get my vault backed up to GitHub automatically
- Started working on [*Server Room Inventory*](https://aretecloud.sharepoint.us/sites/IT/_layouts/15/doc.aspx?sourcedoc={21b8630e-bf6b-4349-8c41-3602efa149e4}&action=edit) doc in SharePoint
	- Need to further flesh out the storage purpose of each room
	- Creating Project [[FC Server Room Inventory]]
- Worked with Devon & Hunter regarding the Board Room and TVs. We ordered two 85inch TVs and they are currently too big for the conference table and room. We are looking into:
	- Smaller 75inch TVs
	- Stacking them on top of each other
	- Moving the existing TVs to a different wall 
	- Getting a different conference table (currently thinking U-shaped)
