- [x] Found steps to factory reset and pair devices and user was able to connect headset after
 1.     Turn the headset off   
 2.     While wearing the headset, press and hold the multifunction button, you will hear "Power on, battery high", but keep holding a couple more seconds and you should hear it play a chime. (If you keep holding it will turn off again)   
 3.     It should keep playing the pairing chime over and over, give it a 10-15 seconds to make sure.   
 4.     Now press and hold the button on the Jabra DECT USB adapter for 1 second to pair with the headset.
