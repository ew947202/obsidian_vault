## Daily Log
### [[2024-10-09]]
- [ ] Reached out to user to see when they are free for me to remote into the device while they are logged in and reinstall conda as a local user rather than all user.
	- I suspect that the issue is due to it being in the C:\Program Files rather than their local user account
- [ ] Will follow up on [[2024-10-16]]
