### Description
- User is not able to use AdminByRequest due to an error message stating that `Another installation is in progress`.

## Daily Log
### [[2024-10-10]]
- [ ] Found that `msexec.exe` processes are running which usually block the user from installing new software. Killed the task and having the user restart the device to see if they automatically come back up.
