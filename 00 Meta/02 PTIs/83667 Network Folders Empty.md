### Description
- User is showing no devices in the network tab of the file explorer when the device goes to sleep.
	- Likely due to her device loosing connection after being put to sleep. Will check the power settings to see if the computer is set to go to sleep once after a certain time when plugged into power.

- [x] Reached out to user to see when they are free for me to remote into the device and check the power settings.
