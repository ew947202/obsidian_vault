## Daily Log
### [[2024-09-27]]
- [x] Worked with user to get software installed, was unable to get software installed without the board connected to the laptop
	- Spoke with Dario and he confirmed we will need the board connected to the laptop and gave some pointers on how to get it installed.
	 >[!info] Dario convo
	 >when the board gets plugged in it may say it's missing the driver or its not the right one in device manager. you can test to see if it works by running the "hiMOS_Demo" exe located here \\arete\shared\Tucson\Projects\SMART e_PANTS\Software\HiMOS
	 >If it says it failed to read the board or something like that, then go to device manager and manually point the driver of that board to the driver folder location i sent above
