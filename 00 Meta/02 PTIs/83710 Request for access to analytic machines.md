### Description
- User is requesting access to the AM machines

Script:
You have been added to the AM-USERS security group, which will permit you to log into the Analytics Machines (ALAM, AZAM, COAM, DCAM, or LAAM).  If you need access to particular shares or datasets, you will need to submit an ITDesk ticket for those additional folders.  

Please review the information in the following links PRIOR to trying to access these machines, as it will help you understand more about the resources and how they're configured:
