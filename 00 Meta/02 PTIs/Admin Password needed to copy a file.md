### Description
- Before launching onr_realsim in Unreal Engine you must generate the projects binary files. First, ensure no instances of Unreal Engine are running. Next, navigate to the project directory in Explorer, **right-click on 'onr_realsim.uproject' and select 'Generate Visual Studio Project Files'**. If promoted to select an Unreal Engine version for the project, select 5.1 from the provided dropdown. (from [https://bitbucket.corp.arete.com/projects/HYD/repos/onr_realsim/browse](https://bitbucket.corp.arete.com/projects/HYD/repos/onr_realsim/browse)  But do not have the option bolded above. A solution seems to be to take this file: “C:\Program Files (x86)\Epic Games\Launcher\Engine\Binaries\Win64\UnrealVersionSelector.exe”.  And paste it into “C:\Program Files\Epic Games\UE_4.15\Engine\Binaries\Win64” then double click it.  This is suggested [here](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/65462866/cannot-find-options-to-generate-visual-studio-project-files), and other places as a solution. The issue is that I need an administration permission to copy to the folder.  So I basically just need someone to do that for me.  Thanks.
