### Description
- When opening pptx/docx files downloaded from email or from Sharepoint, Word gets stuck with a "Protected view" banner and no document displayed (secreenshot 334 attached). The Enable Editing button doesn't do anything. If I save the file to my computer, it doesn't show the enable editing button but also doesn't display the document (screenshot 336 attached). Sometimes it just crashes. Opening files created on my computer are completely fine. The files downloaded open fine for other people and I can only view them by uploading them to Sharepoint and looking at them with word/powerpoint online

## Daily Log

- [ ] Reached out to user to see if this is only happening with old attachments as this seems to be the same issue that was happening with [[Antonia Shull]] and new Outlook.
