### Description
- User is having issues responding to signed emails.
	- [[Brian Crowell]] note:
		- Signed or encrypted?  There shouldn't be an issue with signed emails, but if they're encrypted, he'll need to exchange keys with the sender. [link](https://aretecloud.sharepoint.us/sites/it/faqs/how%20to%20-%20use%20digital%20certificates%20for%20email.aspx?web=1).  If he doesn't have a globalsign cert, then we'll need to confirm that he's required to exchange encrypted emails with our customers.  If they're only signed, then this may be an issue where Outlook needs to be patched.
