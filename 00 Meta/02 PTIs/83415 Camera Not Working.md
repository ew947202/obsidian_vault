## Daily Log
### [[2024-09-09]]
- [x] Reaching out to user to see when they are free.
	- Likely because the camera is plugged into the back of the monitor 
- [x] Stopped by users office, was able to get the camera working. It seems to have stopped working during the power outage and needed to be plugged back into the computer rather than the monitor for the system to identify it.
