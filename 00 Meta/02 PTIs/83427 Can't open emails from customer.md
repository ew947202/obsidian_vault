### [[2024-09-10]]
- Found [this](https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/outlook_com/forum/all/outlook-2019-cannot-open-emails-with-digital/9cfd8a20-764b-4621-9c66-cfe99287ba9a) link that has a few ideas for troubleshooting this error message. 
- [x] Reached out to user to see when they are free for me to remote into the device, following up on [[2024-09-17]]
- [x] Common issue with this customer's emails since they switched to a different software. [[Zandy Williams]] let [[Seth Zuckerman]] know that there is a workaround for now. I let user know that IT would need more information before we are able to troubleshoot the issue further.
