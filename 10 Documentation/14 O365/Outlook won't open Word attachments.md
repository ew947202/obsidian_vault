## Issue
- Currently in the new Word and Outlook versions when you try to open an email with a word attachment sent from previous versions of Word or Outlook it will open in a blank word document. This does not happen for any attachment sent after the update to the two applications



### Current workaround
- Open Word, go to ``File > Options > Trust Center > Trust Center Settings > Protected View > Uncheck 'Enable Protected View for Outlook Attachments' > Ok > Ok``
