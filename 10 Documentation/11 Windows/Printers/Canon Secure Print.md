## Secure Print breaks if you are printing an image from the photos app

If you are trying to print an image it seems that Cannon and Secure Print block any jobs coming from the default Windows Photo app. A current workaround is changing the default app for photo viewer to Paint. Looking into a solution to allow the print jobs coming from the Windows Photo app to be passed through the windows print server.

### Current Workaround
*Switching the default app to Paint*
1. Windows Search 'Default Apps'
2. Select Photo viewer
3. Select Paint
